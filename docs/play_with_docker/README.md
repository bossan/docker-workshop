## Play with Docker

Instead of installing Docker on your local machine, you can use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com) for this tutorial.

You will need an account to use this service. Create your account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

### How to use Play with Docker

First, click on **Login** and select **docker** to login using a Docker Hub account.

After you have logged in, you can click on **Start**. You should now see a sidebar with a timer and a red **CLOSE SESSION** button along with a few other options.

Create a new instance by clicking on **+ ADD NEW INSTANCE**. This might take a couple of seconds. A terminal should appear.

You are now ready to use Docker!
